### Rules in Name

DLST classifies library file names as below: 

```
{filename}.{extension}
{filename}-{version}.{extension}
{filename}_{version}.{extension}
{filename} {version}.{extension}
```

For a search,  it compare excluding version or extension.<br>
Find out the version in the following format.
```
Regular expression : [a-zA-Z]?(\d+)(.\d+)?(.\d+)?(.\d+))

* Ïòà : 1.0 / 1.0.0 / 1.0.0.0 / v1.0.0 / r1.2 / a2.3.4
```

* Examples of File Name Conversion
    ```
    aaa-1.0.0.jar -> aaa.jar
    bbb-2.2.2.aar -> bbb.aar
    ccc-1.aar -> ccc-1.aar
    ddd-v1.aar -> ddd-v1.aar
    ddd-v1.0.0.aar -> ddd.aar
    eee-vvv.aar -> eee-vvv.aar
    ```
* Example of Search
    * Determined as a duplicate library. 
        ```
        aaa-1.0.0.jar -> aaa.jar
        aaa-2.0.0.jar -> aaa.jar
        aaa-v3.0.0.jar -> aaa.jar
        ```
    * Determined not as a duplicate library.
        ```
        bbb-2.2.2.aar -> bbb.aar
        bbbb-2.2.2.aar -> bbbb.aar
        bbb-ccc.aar -> bbb-ccc.aar
        ```

### Search Options 

* Ignore particular character strings in a library name 
    * Particular character strings may be ignored in the search of a file name.
        ```
        * Example of Configuration 
            File name: com.android.support.support-v4-25.3.1.aar
            Character strings to ignore: com.android.support.
            File name applied with ignored character strings applied: support-v4-25.3.1.aar
            File name excluding version or extension, for a search: support-v4

        * Example of Search
            Character strings to ignore: com.android.support.
            File 1
                com.android.support.support-v4-25.3.1.aar
                -> File name for search: support-v4
            File 2
                support-v4-27.0.0.aar
                -> File name for search: support-v4
            - Determined as a duplicate library, after search
        ```
* Library names to be excluded from search 
    * Names that are same as configured for search are excluded from search. 
        ```
        * Example of Configuration 1

        Library name to exclude: play-services-auth

        File name
            play-services-auth-15.0.1.aar
            -> File name for search: play-services-auth
